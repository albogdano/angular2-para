This is an example application for managing recipes, built with Angular and Para.
It is part of a tutorial on [how to get started quickly with Angular](http://www.erudika.com/blog/2016/06/09/Building-the-stack-from-scratch-with-Angular-2/) 
and how to integrate your Angular frontend with a Para backend.
It's a simple recipe manager app with:

- CRUD functionality for recipes
- Full-text search
- Markdown support

## [Live DEMO](http://albogdano.github.io/angular2-para/)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
